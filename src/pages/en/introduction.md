**Welcome to the Legato Protocol!**

Legato Protocol deals with representing Intellectual Property, it's royalties and licenses on chain. It will provide the following benefits:

- ✅ **Create an on-chain regitry of IP**
- ✅ **Represent the royalty portions of an IP**
- ✅ **Create licenses that can be purchase for this IP on chain**

## Based on upcoming EIP standards

Legato protocol will utilize a few EIP standards that are currently in draft mode: 
- [EIP-721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) : NFT Standard
- [EIP-5553](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-5553.md) : Representing IP and its Royalty Structure
- [EIP-5128](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-5218.md) : NFT Rights Management
